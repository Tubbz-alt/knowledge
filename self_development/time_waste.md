# Use your time

> There’s More Than Enough Time, When You Use The Time You Have
> - Benjamin P. Hardy

What you choose to do in every minute of your life determines:

- Who you are
- Who you will become
- What you will accomplish in your days, and in your live
- How deep your relationships are
- And ultimately what you value most

Rules you want to follow:

- Be Where You Are: In Mind And Body - awareness, what your are doing right now, be there, not somewhere else.
- Focus on the most important things, not good, not better but on the best things to do - Step back and ask yourself **"Is this the best possible use of my time?"**
- Always Take The Higher Road - become consistent — even automatic — at choosing the harder, better road. Find joy in being and becoming the person you desire to be. You can develop confidence using your time in meaningful ways, and positively impacting those around you.
- Be Who You Ideally Want To Become, Today -
