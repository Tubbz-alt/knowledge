# Programming and other technical stufss

Currently it is hard to follow all arounding us things there. I agree with the theory introduced by Sacha Greif, how the learning patter is looking now in the tech industry.

1. Dismissal

One more `library`? I can use stuffs that I already know.

2. Interest

Hmmm, maybe I should check out this new library I keep hearing about ... ?

3. Panic

Help! I need to learn this new library **right now** or I'll be completely obsolete

We should try to maintain the fast-moving times to learn new stuffs between 2 and 3
