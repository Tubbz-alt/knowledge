### Logic Level Converter

**Q. What is logical state?**

The logical state is a boolean value `true` or `false` in electronic we recognize this when the Voltage on pins will reach some Voltage. If for example, we have a board of logical level 5V, we need to provide to our pin voltage 5V to turn this pin into `true` value.

**Q. What for?**

Some boards represent logical states in different Voltage level. And if we want to communicate the state between the two we need to convert it.

**Q. What are the most common Voltage Logical Level?**

Most common voltage levels are:
- 5V - Arduino
- 3.3V - ESP8266
