# Use your time

> There’s More Than Enough Time, When You Use The Time You Have
> - Benjamin P. Hardy

What you choose to do in every minute of your life determines:

- Who you are
- Who you will become
- What you will accomplish in your days, and in your live
- How deep your relationships are
- And ultimately what you value most

Rules you want to follow:

- Be Where You Are: In Mind And Body - awareness, what your are doing right now, be there, not somewhere else.
- Focus on the most important things, not good, not better but on the best things to do - Step back and ask yourself **"Is this the best possible use of my time?"**
> If something is not a HELL YES!, it’s a no. End of story. If you are not 100% behind what you’re currently doing, stop doing it. There are certainly better things you could be doing.
