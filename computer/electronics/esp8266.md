### Communication

Communication goes through UART protocol, which is combined with TX RX pins.

### Power

To power this module we need Voltage level 3.3V. And we could supply our ESP8266 module with the Arduino pin with voltage level 3.3V. But the electric current efficiency level can be to low to support our ESP8266 board so we should try to level down our voltage from the pin with voltage level 5V. To do this we can use Voltage Tension Regulator [lm317.md](LM317)
